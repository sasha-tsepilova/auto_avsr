This repository is a part of the thesis arthefacts. It contains modified codes from [auto-avsr](https://github.com/mpc001/auto_avsr), [torch audio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio), adapted to the new way of preprocessing visual stream. To use any of the scripts you can follow the same instruction as in the original repositories. To train the Auto-AVSR in the same way as described in thesis, you'll need to add the [`avsr_trlrwlrs2lrs3vox2avsp_base.pth`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mU6MHzXMiq1m6GI-8gqT2zc2bdStuBXu/view?usp=sharing) to the root directory of the project.

## Acknowledgement

This repository is built using the [auto-avsr](https://github.com/mpc001/auto_avsr), [torch audio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio) (specifically avsr part) repositories.
